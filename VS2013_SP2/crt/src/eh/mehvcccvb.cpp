*Purpose:
*       These functions are called when constructing and destructing arrays of
*       objects.  Their purpose is to assure that constructed elements get
*       destructed if the constructor for one of the elements throws.
*
*       Must be compiled using "-d1Binl" to be able to specify __thiscall
*       at the user level
